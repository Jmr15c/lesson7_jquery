### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. In this lesson, I learned how JavaScript commands can actually be implemented with very minimal amounts of code using jQuery shortcuts. These shortcuts often look like other languages. When completing the end of lesson assignment, the codes used remidned me alot of Java commands.
2. The JavaScript Console pane can be opned from the browser window that previes the file, and code can be implemented (not permanently). This lets programmers better preview what changes would look like and how it work impact their files. 
3. in jQuery you can easily change multiple elements at once. The Console Pane lets you implement changes to one instance of a heading or aspect of a document, to all headings, or specific ones. For example, all h3 elements, or all li elements.
